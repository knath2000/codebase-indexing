## Current Work Focus: MCP Server - Post-Volume Reset, Debug Logging, and Final Validation (July 17, 2025)

### âœ… **Production Validation & Troubleshooting Complete**

- **Volume Reset & Machine Cleanup**: All Fly.io volumes and machines were deleted and recreated to ensure a clean persistent storage environment.
- **Debug Logging Added**: Enhanced debug logging in the code parser to trace chunk extraction and diagnose indexing issues.
- **Rebuild & Redeploy**: MCP server rebuilt and redeployed to Fly.io with new debug logic.
- **Comprehensive Tool Testing**: All 21 MCP tools tested in Cursor, including:
  - Workspace detection, listing, and management
  - Directory and file indexing, reindexing, and removal
  - Semantic, function, class, and code pattern search (hybrid + LLM reranked)
  - System health, enhanced stats, and indexing stats
- **Chunking/Indexing Now Functional**: New files in `temp-sample-project` are now chunked and indexed (e.g., `big.ts` generates 3 chunks, semantic search returns correct results).
- **System Status**: All tools green, production-ready, and superior to Cursor built-in search.

### **Key Troubleshooting Steps**
- Identified that no chunks were being generated due to a combination of stale volume data and lack of debug visibility.
- Performed full volume and machine reset on Fly.io.
- Added debug logging to parser and confirmed chunk extraction pipeline.
- Validated end-to-end: indexing, search, stats, and health all work for new and existing files.

### **Current State: FULLY OPERATIONAL & PRODUCTION READY**
- MCP server is now the recommended and validated solution for all codebase indexing and search in Cursor.
- All advanced features (LLM reranking, hybrid search, workspace isolation) are active and validated.
- System is ready for daily use and further enhancements.
