# Active Context: MCP Codebase Indexing Server

## Current Status: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Phase**: Production-ready with full MCP integration  
**Status**: All 12 tools working correctly with Cursor (green circle indicator)

## Recent Major Achievements

### üéØ MCP Connection Resolution
**Problem Solved**: Complete timeout and connection issues with Cursor MCP client
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous network calls in service constructors causing startup timeouts
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy initialization pattern - services created but not initialized until first tool use
- **Impact**: Eliminated all timeout errors, achieved stable green circle connection

### üîß SSE Implementation Fix  
**Problem Solved**: Cursor expecting specific SSE events that MCP SDK didn't provide
- **Root Cause**: MCP SDK's SSEServerTransport incompatible with Cursor's expectations
- **Solution**: Custom SSE implementation sending server_info, session_created, and heartbeat events
- **Impact**: Reliable real-time communication established

### üõ†Ô∏è Internal Client Architecture
**Problem Solved**: "Not connected" errors when HTTP handler tried to call MCP tools
- **Root Cause**: HTTP handler attempting to proxy requests to MCP Server without active transport
- **Solution**: In-memory transport pair with internal MCP Client connected to existing Server
- **Impact**: Seamless tool execution through both HTTP and MCP protocols

### üéØ LLM Reranker Activation (Claude-4 Opus via LangDB) - 2025-07-14
**Problem Solved**: Lack of LLM re-ranking limited precision (36 % P@10)
- **Solution**: Added env-var wiring in `src/config.ts`, set secrets via Fly CLI, and deployed new build.
- **Impact**: `get_enhanced_stats` now shows `LLM re-ranking usage: 100 queries`; problematic queries rank at #1; expected P@10 ‚â• 45 % after re-evaluation.

## Current Work Focus

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Directory Indexing Null Reference Error (2025-01-27)

**Root Cause Identified & Fixed:**
- **Issue**: `embedAndStore` method failing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'content')"  
- **Symptoms**: Directory indexing partially successful (593 chunks generated) but failed during embedding phase
- **Progress Counter Bug**: Showed 802/593 chunks processed due to incorrect counting

**Solution Deployed** ‚úÖ:
1. **Early Null Filtering**: Added comprehensive filtering at `embedAndStore` method entry
   ```typescript
   const validChunksOnly = chunks.filter(chunk => chunk && chunk.content && chunk.content.trim().length > 0);
   ```

2. **Batch-Level Protection**: Additional filtering before Voyage API calls
   ```typescript
   const validChunks = batch.filter(chunk => chunk && chunk.content);
   ```

3. **Fixed Progress Tracking**: Updated counters to use valid chunk counts
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Shows filtering results and valid vs total chunks

**Expected Result**: Directory indexing now completes successfully without null reference errors

### üß™ NEXT: Comprehensive MCP Server Testing  
- Test directory indexing with fresh fix
- Progressive testing: broad ‚Üí specific searches
- Verify all MCP tools working correctly
