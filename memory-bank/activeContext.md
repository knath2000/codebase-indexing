# Active Context: MCP Codebase Indexing Server

## Current Status: ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Phase**: Production-ready with full MCP integration  
**Status**: All 12 tools working correctly with Cursor (green circle indicator)

## Recent Major Achievements

### üéØ MCP Connection Resolution
**Problem Solved**: Complete timeout and connection issues with Cursor MCP client
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous network calls in service constructors causing startup timeouts
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy initialization pattern - services created but not initialized until first tool use
- **Impact**: Eliminated all timeout errors, achieved stable green circle connection

### üîß SSE Implementation Fix  
**Problem Solved**: Cursor expecting specific SSE events that MCP SDK didn't provide
- **Root Cause**: MCP SDK's SSEServerTransport incompatible with Cursor's expectations
- **Solution**: Custom SSE implementation sending server_info, session_created, and heartbeat events
- **Impact**: Reliable real-time communication established

### üõ†Ô∏è Internal Client Architecture
**Problem Solved**: "Not connected" errors when HTTP handler tried to call MCP tools
- **Root Cause**: HTTP handler attempting to proxy requests to MCP Server without active transport
- **Solution**: In-memory transport pair with internal MCP Client connected to existing Server
- **Impact**: Seamless tool execution through both HTTP and MCP protocols

## Current Work Focus

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session
1. **Fixed lazy initialization** - Services now initialize on first tool call
2. **Resolved SSE compatibility** - Custom SSE implementation for Cursor
3. **Eliminated "Not connected" errors** - Internal client-server architecture  
4. **Deployed production fixes** - All changes live on Fly.io
5. **Verified end-to-end functionality** - All 12 tools accessible via Cursor

### üéØ Active Tasks
1. **Memory Bank Initialization** - Creating comprehensive project documentation
2. **README Enhancement** - Improving user onboarding and customization guides
3. **Knowledge Consolidation** - Documenting lessons learned for future maintenance

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Critical Technical Insights
1. **Lazy Initialization is Essential**: Network-dependent services must defer initialization to prevent startup timeouts
2. **Custom SSE Required for Cursor**: Standard MCP SDK SSE transport insufficient for Cursor compatibility  
3. **Internal Client Pattern**: HTTP endpoints need internal MCP client for tool reuse without duplication
4. **Deployment via GitHub**: Fly.io GitHub integration provides seamless CI/CD without Fly CLI

### Performance Insights
- **Startup Time**: Lazy initialization reduced startup from 30+ seconds to <1 second
- **Connection Stability**: Custom SSE with heartbeat prevents connection drops
- **Tool Response Time**: Internal client eliminates network round trips for HTTP requests

### Development Process Insights
- **Incremental Fixes**: Solving one connection issue at a time led to comprehensive solution
- **End-to-End Testing**: Manual Cursor testing crucial for validating MCP compatibility
- **Memory Documentation**: Systematic knowledge capture prevents repeated debugging

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish all required memory-bank files (progress.md remaining)
2. **Enhanced README**: Update with customization guide and troubleshooting
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all setup instructions are accurate and complete

### Short-term (Next Sessions)  
1. **Usage Analytics**: Add optional telemetry for understanding tool usage patterns
2. **Error Monitoring**: Implement structured logging for production monitoring
3. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize embedding batch processing
4. **Language Support**: Add support for additional programming languages

### Long-term (Future Development)
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Design multi-instance architecture for large organizations
2. **Caching Layer**: Implement embedding caching for frequently accessed code
3. **Advanced Search**: Add filtering by code complexity, recency, or author
4. **Integration Tests**: Automated MCP protocol compliance testing

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Clear separation between IndexingService and SearchService
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variables with sensible defaults
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interface definitions

### Deployment Strategy
- **GitHub-based Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers Fly.io deployment
- **Environment Configuration**: Secrets managed through Fly.io environment variables
- **Health Monitoring**: HTTP endpoints for service health verification
- **Rollback Capability**: Manual rollback via Fly.io dashboard if needed

### Testing Approach
- **Manual Cursor Testing**: Primary validation method for MCP compatibility
- **Service Unit Testing**: Individual component testing with mocked dependencies  
- **Integration Validation**: End-to-end tool execution verification
- **Performance Testing**: Large codebase indexing and search benchmarks

## Critical Dependencies

### External Services
- **Voyage AI**: Embedding generation (voyage-code-2 model)
- **Qdrant**: Vector storage and similarity search
- **Fly.io**: Hosting and deployment platform
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

### Internal Components
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for protocol implementation
- **Tree-sitter**: Code parsing and semantic analysis
- **Express.js**: HTTP server framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development environment

## Risk Mitigation

### Service Reliability
- **Lazy Initialization**: Prevents startup timeouts and service failures
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of external service failures
- **Connection Health**: SSE heartbeat and reconnection logic
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable file size and batch processing limits

### Maintenance Considerations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive memory bank for knowledge preservation
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear service boundaries for independent updates
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment-based configuration for different deployments
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging and health endpoints for operations
