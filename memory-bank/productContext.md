# Product Context: MCP Codebase Indexing Server

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
AI assistants like Cursor need to understand large codebases to provide meaningful assistance, but traditional file-based context has limitations:

1. **Context Window Limitations**: AI models have finite context windows, making it impossible to load entire codebases
2. **Inefficient Code Discovery**: Finding relevant code requires manual navigation or basic text search
3. **Semantic Understanding Gap**: Text search misses semantically related code that uses different terminology
4. **Fragmented Knowledge**: Code understanding is scattered across files without semantic relationships
5. **Integration Complexity**: Each AI assistant implements custom codebase understanding differently

### The Solution
Our MCP server solves these problems by providing:

1. **Semantic Code Search**: Uses AI embeddings to find code by meaning, not just keywords
2. **Structured Code Understanding**: Parses code into meaningful chunks (functions, classes, modules)
3. **Standardized Interface**: MCP protocol ensures compatibility across AI assistants
4. **Efficient Indexing**: Incremental updates and vector storage for fast retrieval
5. **Context-Aware Results**: Provides relevant code chunks with proper context

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **AI Assistant Users**: Developers using Cursor who need better codebase understanding
- **Enterprise Teams**: Large organizations with complex codebases requiring semantic search
- **Code Reviewers**: Teams needing to quickly understand unfamiliar code sections

### Secondary Users  
- **AI Assistant Developers**: Teams building AI coding tools that need codebase indexing
- **DevTool Builders**: Companies creating developer productivity tools
- **Research Teams**: Academic groups studying code understanding and retrieval

## User Experience Goals

### For AI Assistant Users
1. **Invisible Intelligence**: Code search works transparently through their AI assistant
2. **Relevant Results**: Searches return semantically relevant code, not just keyword matches  
3. **Fast Response**: Near-instantaneous search results even for large codebases
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Results include proper context for understanding code purpose

### For Developers/Integrators
1. **Easy Setup**: Simple installation and configuration process
2. **Reliable Operation**: Stable server with minimal downtime or connection issues
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable to different codebase types and sizes
4. **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup and usage
