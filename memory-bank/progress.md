## üìã Planned Features (Short-term)

### Core Cursor Parity Features
- [ ] **AST-Based Chunking**: Tree-sitter semantic parsing for functions/classes vs. fixed-size blocks

- [ ] **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine dense semantic + sparse keyword search with score blending
- [ ] **LLM Re-ranking**: Secondary LLM stage for relevance scoring before UI presentation
- [ ] **Code Reference Format**: Implement Cursor's JSON schema with `path`, `lines`, `snippet`

### Operational Excellence  
- [ ] **Health Endpoints**: `/healthz` and `/stats` for monitoring and telemetry
- [ ] **Context Budget Management**: Token counting with smart truncation for model limits
- [ ] **Search Caching**: Memoize identical queries for performance optimization
- [ ] **File-watch Batching**: Debounced incremental updates to avoid indexing thrashing

## üêõ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
- **Configuration Reload**: Server restart required for config changes
- **Large File Handling**: Memory usage can spike with very large files
- **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more descriptive
- **Logging Verbosity**: Needs tunable logging levels

### Technical Debt
- **Test Coverage**: Need comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Code Documentation**: Some complex functions need better comments
