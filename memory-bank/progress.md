## 🎉 Recently Resolved (January 2025)

### Session Management & Stability Issues - FULLY RESOLVED ✅
- [x] **Multi-Instance Session Affinity Issue**: Fixed "Invalid or expired session" errors 
  - **Root Cause**: SSE connections on one Fly.io instance, POST requests routed to different instances
  - **Solution**: Single instance deployment (fly.toml: min_count=1, max_count=1)
  - **Result**: 100% reliable MCP connections, no more connection flapping
- [x] **Null Reference Errors in Directory Indexing**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of null" errors
  - **Root Cause 1**: Null chunks reaching embedAndStore method when content too small
  - **Root Cause 2**: updateStats method accessing .content on null chunks  
  - **Solution**: Comprehensive null filtering at multiple levels
  - **Result**: Clean successful directory indexing with 549 chunks generated
- [x] **Enhanced Session Debugging**: Added comprehensive session lifecycle logging
- [x] **Instance Tracking**: Added FLY_ALLOC_ID logging for multi-instance debugging

### Test Results (Post-LLM Reranker)
- ✅ 10/10 queries achieve 100 % recall, Avg First Rank ≈ 1.9
- 🚀 Average Precision@10 improved from 36.7 % → **48.3 %** (evaluation harness)

## 🚧 In Progress (July 2025)

### LLM Reranker Production Stabilization
- TLS certificate and DNS issues resolved; reranker now invoked for all searches.
- Current blocker: Sporadic `500 Internal Server Error` responses from LangDB gateway. Graceful fallback is active but precision gains are reduced.
- Next steps: implement exponential back-off + retry, open support ticket with LangDB, and evaluate fallback to Anthropic direct endpoint.

### Metrics To Watch
- `LLM re-ranking usage` counter should increase without matching `reranker_error` increments.
- Track proportion of queries where reranker returns non-error via enhanced stats endpoint.

**Overall Completion** remains 95 % but reliability work continues.
