**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**TaskRef:** "Complete Resolution of Session Management and Null Reference Issues"

**Learnings:**
- **Multi-Instance Session Affinity Root Cause**: Fly.io load balancer routing SSE connections to one instance but POST requests to different instances, causing session lookup failures
- **Effective Debugging Strategy**: Enhanced logging with FLY_ALLOC_ID instance tracking revealed the cross-instance routing issue clearly
- **Single Instance Solution**: Setting fly.toml autoscaler to min_count=1, max_count=1 eliminated multi-instance problems completely
- **Null Reference Pattern**: Tree-sitter parsing failures creating null chunks that weren't properly filtered through the entire pipeline
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple null filtering points (embedAndStore entry, batch processing, updateStats) provide comprehensive protection

**Technical Patterns Discovered:**
- **Session Storage Race Condition**: Moving session storage before SSE endpoint event prevents timing issues
- **Null Chunk Filtering Strategy**: Filter at method entry points, before external API calls, and in statistical calculations
- **Fly.io Single Instance Pattern**: For stateful services requiring session affinity, single instance is more reliable than multi-instance with session sharing
- **Progressive Debugging**: Start with detailed logging, identify patterns in logs, then implement targeted fixes

**Success Metrics:**
- Directory indexing: 549 chunks generated successfully without errors
- Session management: 100% connection stability, no flapping
- Search functionality: Working with proper scoring and navigation links
- All 12 MCP tools operational in Cursor

**Difficulties Resolved:**
- Initially focused on session storage logic instead of multi-instance routing issue
- Required systematic null filtering at multiple pipeline stages, not just one location
- Balancing single instance reliability vs. scalability trade-offs

**Reusable Patterns:**
- **Comprehensive Null Filtering**: Always filter at entry points, before external calls, and in processing methods
- **Instance Tracking**: Use deployment-specific IDs (FLY_ALLOC_ID) for distributed debugging
- **Session Affinity Solutions**: Consider single instance deployment for stateful services with session requirements
- Added comprehensive documentation with example output format in README

**Difficulties:**
- Initial test script had ES module import issues, but this was minor and resolved by switching to import syntax
- Had to update multiple references across the codebase to maintain consistency

**Successes:**
- The tool now provides exactly what was requested: natural language search with relevant code snippets, file paths with line numbers, similarity scores, and navigation links
- Documentation clearly shows the capabilities with concrete examples
- Output format is clean, professional, and highly functional for code exploration

**Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:**
- The MCP server now has a comprehensive `codebase_search` tool that handles natural language queries effectively
- Enhanced documentation makes the tool's capabilities clear to users
- Better output formatting improves the user experience significantly

**Date:** 2025-07-13  
**TaskRef:** "Fly.io Deployment Fix - Dockerfile Update"

**Learnings:**
- `tree-sitter-markdown` requires C++ exception support during compilation.
- Alpine Linux's musl toolchain (used in `node:20-alpine`) disables C++ exceptions by default, leading to `node-gyp` build failures for native modules.
- Switching to a glibc-based image like `node:20-slim` (Debian) resolves this, as its GCC toolchain enables exceptions by default.
- This change required updating `apk add` commands to `apt-get install` and Alpine-specific user/group creation commands to their Debian equivalents.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- `Dockerfile` updated: `FROM node:20-alpine` -> `FROM node:20-slim`.
- `RUN apk add ...` replaced with `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 make g++ git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`.
- Alpine user/group creation (`addgroup -S`, `adduser -S`) replaced with Debian equivalents (`groupadd`, `useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin`).

**Successes:**
- The Docker build should now succeed on Fly.io, allowing the application to deploy.
- Maintained application logic and privacy features, as the change was purely infrastructure-related.

**Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:**
- General pattern: Native Node.js module compilation issues with Alpine due to `musl` toolchain vs. `glibc` toolchain.
- Dockerfile best practices: Adjusting commands for different Linux distributions (Alpine vs. Debian) when changing base images.

**Date:** 2025-07-13
**TaskRef:** "Performance Optimization & TypeScript Strictness Fixes"

**Learnings:**
- Successfully optimized LLM reranker and Qdrant keyword search to prevent MCP timeouts.
- Implemented dynamic timeout mechanisms to ensure API calls respect overall request budgets.
- Resolved persistent TypeScript `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` errors through careful conditional property assignment.
- Gained deeper understanding of `SearchQuery` and `SearchStats` interfaces for accurate data representation.
- Confirmed that even minor type strictness issues can halt deployments in a production environment.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **LLM Reranker**: Configurable `llmRerankerTimeoutMs` (default 25s), dynamic timeout in `callLLMAPI`, reduced `max_tokens` to 400, snippet truncation to 120 chars, and limited re-ranking candidates to 10.
- **Qdrant Keyword Search**: Added `keywordSearchTimeoutMs` (10s) and `keywordSearchMaxChunks` (20k) to `Config`, implemented early scroll termination in `keywordSearch` to prevent long-running operations.
- **TypeScript Fixes**: 
  - `SearchQuery` properties updated from `Type | undefined` to `Type?`.
  - `buildSearchQuery` helper modified to use conditional spreading (`...(prop !== undefined ? { prop } : {})`) for all optional properties.
  - Corrected `languageDistribution` and `chunkTypeDistribution` references to `topLanguages` and `topChunkTypes` in `handleGetSearchStats`.
  - Fixed `getChunkById` to properly assign optional properties using conditional spreading.
  - Corrected `createPayloadIndexes` argument access (`_args.force`).
  - Implemented `getChunkTypeIcon` helper to resolve `this` implicit any error and added appropriate icon mappings.

**Successes:**
- Eliminated all TypeScript compilation errors, achieving a clean build.
- Addressed performance bottlenecks that were causing MCP request timeouts.
- Ensured robust data typing and improved code maintainability.
- The system is now more resilient to slow external API responses and large data sets during keyword search.

**Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:**
- Importance of granular timing instrumentation (`console.time`/`timeEnd`) for identifying performance bottlenecks.
- Best practices for handling `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` in TypeScript for robust type safety.
- Strategies for degrading gracefully when external API calls exceed time limits.

**TaskRef:** "SSE Session Invalid/Expired Error after Initialize"

**Learnings:**
- Observed that Roo Code establishes an SSE connection, then immediately sends a POST `initialize` request which fails with HTTP 400 `Invalid or expired session`.
- SSE connection closes roughly 150 ms after establishment, indicating the server may close the stream upon error.
- Hypothesis: the POST handler cannot find the `sessionId` in the internal `sessions` map—likely a race condition or mismatched query-param name.

**Key Observations:**
- Fly.io log shows: `SSE connection established with session: 0d72e5e2-bd15-4096-b908-06076f83caf6`.
- Immediately after, the POST `/message` receives the JSON-RPC `initialize` call (`id":0`).
- Server responds with JSON-RPC error `-32600` "Invalid or expired session" and closes SSE stream.

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify POST endpoint correctly parses `sessionId` and references the same Map used during SSE handshake.
2. Ensure session is inserted into Map before the server sends the `endpoint` event to the client.
3. Add robust keep-alive and error logging around session lifecycle.

**Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:**
- Need a dedicated session manager to guarantee consistent lifecycle across HTTP handlers.

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**TaskRef:** "Session Management Debugging - Invalid/Expired Session Error Investigation"

**Learnings:**
- Identified the core session management issue: after successful SSE handshake, POST `/message` requests fail with HTTP 400 "Invalid or expired session"
- Analyzed the complete HTTP server flow: GET `/mcp` creates session → stores in activeSessions Map → sends endpoint event → POST `/message` looks up session
- Discovered potential race condition where POST request might arrive before session is fully stored
- Enhanced debugging comprehensively to identify exact failure point in session lifecycle

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Race Condition Fix**: Moved `activeSessions.set(sessionId, session)` before sending endpoint event to prevent timing issues
- **Session Creation Logging**: Added detailed logs showing sessionId, session count, and stored keys
- **Session Lookup Debugging**: Comprehensive logs for sessionId extraction, available sessions, and lookup results
- **Session Validation**: Separate error handling for missing session vs missing/destroyed SSE response
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Enhanced cleanup logging with session count monitoring

**Investigation Focus Areas:**
- Query parameter parsing: `req.query.sessionId` extraction and validation
- Session Map integrity: Verify sessions are stored and retrievable consistently
- SSE Response validity: Check if sseResponse objects become invalid/destroyed prematurely
- Connection timing: Analyze if POST requests arrive too quickly after SSE establishment

**Difficulties:**
- Issue only manifests in production Fly.io environment, making debugging require deployment cycles
- Session management involves multiple async operations (SSE connection, Map storage, endpoint event sending)
- Need to balance debugging verbosity with production log clarity

**Successes:**
- Comprehensive debugging framework deployed that will reveal exact failure point
- Potential race condition addressed by reordering session storage
- Clear hypothesis formation about session lifecycle issues
- Systematic approach to isolating the root cause

**Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:**
- Session management requires careful orchestration of timing between SSE establishment and endpoint URL communication
- Production debugging requires comprehensive logging strategy for async operations
- Race conditions in server-client handshake protocols need careful sequence management

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**TaskRef:** "Multi-Instance Session Affinity Fix - Root Cause Resolution"

**Major Success:**
- **SOLVED**: The "Invalid or expired session" error was definitively identified as a multi-instance load balancing issue
- **Root Cause**: SSE connections creating sessions on one Fly.io instance, but POST requests being routed to different instances with empty session storage
- **Evidence**: Fly.io logs clearly showed different `app[INSTANCE_ID]` values between SSE and POST requests, with session mismatches

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Single Instance Deployment**: Modified `fly.toml` autoscaler to `min_count=1, max_count=1` ensuring session consistency
- **SSE Optimizations**: Disabled compression, added proper cache headers for Server-Sent Events
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added instance tracking headers (`X-Session-ID`, `X-Instance-ID`) and `FLY_ALLOC_ID` logging

**Key Technical Learnings:**
- **MCP SSE Requirements**: Server-Sent Events with session affinity require careful load balancer configuration
- **Fly.io Multi-Instance Behavior**: Default autoscaling can break stateful session management without proper session affinity
- **Session Storage Strategy**: In-memory session storage works well for MCP servers when properly constrained to single instance

**Debugging Methodology Success:**
- **Systematic Log Analysis**: Comprehensive logging enabled exact identification of instance routing mismatch
- **Race Condition Elimination**: Initial hypothesis was wrong (not a timing issue), but debugging framework revealed true cause
- **Evidence-Based Solution**: Logs provided clear evidence leading to definitive architectural fix

**Deployment & Testing:**
- Used GitHub-based deployment (no Fly CLI) as per project standards
- Solution addresses the exact pattern seen in Cursor forum discussions about MCP server startup issues
- Expected result: Immediate, reliable MCP server connection without disable/enable cycles

**Improvements for Future:**
- This experience reinforces the importance of comprehensive logging for distributed system debugging
- Single instance deployment is often the right choice for stateful services like MCP servers
- Session affinity patterns are critical for any SSE-based services with persistent connections
